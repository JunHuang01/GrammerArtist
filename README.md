This project's goal was to implement a moasic generator based on Key Word specified, and find the image from tumblr with the key word.

Before you can use and play around with this project, you will have to add your own tumblr API Keys in Scrapper.py to make it functional.

The latest version is soley wrote by Trevor Prater with Python + Redis, he implemented the mosaic generator himself in the latest one.

Current State of this repo
==============

API is implemented to be able to pass image to a front end client so that we can display the Mosaiced Image.

The scrapper is a focused crawler on tumblr to find image associated with specific keyword provided.

The front end client would be a viewer that get a url of already hosted image link to display the image, and be able to resize these images for viewing like it shows in the video linked above.
